For not only would the Sultan pay a very generous sum for a rug he deemed worthy, but one who found favor with the Sultan would see his business grow exceptionally. \" Fit for the Feet of a King! \" a merchant could boast, increasing his prices as much as he liked while growing rich on the profits that the royal endorsement would bring. Tradesmen from across the land flooded into the entrance of the Sultan's palace, setting their best rugs up against walls, across balconies, and sprawled out across the floor."

Like most people, he walked the cobblestone streets, no longer under threat of dragon attack. Jim-Jam stopped and took a seat next to the the Jar-Jam memorial statue which sits in the main square. \" One goal, one gift, one future. - General Jar-Jam (dragon defense division) \" The dedication plaque gleamed brightly in the midday sun. A reminder of the sacrifice made by the elders just 10 years ago. From his pocket satchel, Jim-Jam pulled out a dragon roast sandwich and took an ambitious bite. He chewed voraciously as he watched the lives of his bustling village play out. There was Jay-Jam, the village spiritual leader."

However, due to the size of the Glowing Orb, the the subjects had already been distributed around the planet. As it would be extremely detrimental to the collective if the Glowing Orb itself were to die, attempts were made to maintain the cohesion of this colossal collective."

The only things that are off the hook are her eyes and her body. You do not like having to walk in front of her because her eyes seem to watch you with an obsessive, spiteful eye. She has been here more times than you are aware of. Her gaze alone is sufficient to end the social harmony. Her breath makes the air sour, the way the wind grabs at her skin. Her skin glows with the poison of the city. You do not like the daily walk in the traffic."

He had heard that I recently made a movie and suggested that she contact me because she was trying to expand her photography business to include personalized videos, as well. She started sending me long emails, explaining her thoughts and ideas. The project sounded like fun, so I offered to help her shoot the first session, so I could also teach her about videography.

Many of them could not understand, when they found older history books, why so many people had killed other people if everybody was good. To remedy this, history books were made illegal. In their stead, history was rewritten ; rather, it was sanitized, so that it fit into what the world should have been. Eventually, the children forgot about the history books. If any child happened to ask about those texts, the other children would belittle that child for making up stories that simply couldn't be true. And thus was the first of three lies taught.

He ruled far and wide and did not hear any word of his younger brother, a sixteen year old boy of seven, but there was something he did not notice. He did not see his own age, his son, nor his widow, nor the glory of his youth, but he could feel his own vulnerability at the times when he made it to meet his brothers in arms. And so, as he walked, he became that weak-willed youth, fully aware of his wounds, all the better to bear. As a young man, he thought that he may never be King, that perhaps his brothers would view him differently, and kill him, as he had done so many times before."

While standing next to your window, you hear inaudible voices outside which are quickly followed by snickering. Coughing to clear your throat (it's been a few days since you've had to communicate in person, rather than animal) you voice a stern, \" Hello? \", then the snickering stops, and your room starts to return to normal.

Seeing the shit played out over and over again against such fragile metal walls has inspired me to discover that I'm not one of those veterans who's seen things worse than the horror they find themselves in. There were times when I took out my trusty M16 and pumped up my belly load until the walls crumbled under my body. Many nights I'd dance around the second-story bunker, and look at the outside. The grass was green, the vegetation was lush, and the clouds were blue. The ceiling didn't open any larger than it normally would, no I meant just that. But it never felt like I was truly inhabiting a different world."

    "story": "As far as time travel goes, there's something peculiar about time bending that's as troubling as gravity. It's been theorized that gravity can be neutralized using a compound hydrogen atom as the foundation, similar to how a world would be a sphere in the plane of time. That's right - everything's been made so fluid that we no longer need gravity to move around, it's instead act as a stasis field. The theory is that you're looking at a static, and your atoms are floating in a vacuum, that's exactly what the time stretching warping does, the ionization of your atoms as they snap back to spacetime. In order to explain it better, we 'll turn to quantum mechanics. Not one, but a few, things that explain it all."

His long, dark hair hung over his deep face of wrinkles defined by dirt. He held a sign that was torn and water logged but legible. \" I can read minds. Think of a song and I 'll play it, \" it read. I walked towards him as I sang \" Bohemian Rhaphsody \" in my head. In seconds, the notes bounced of the tiles walls, reflecting sound through the empty space. His voice rattled through my veins, and I began to shake. Then he stopped. I raised my eyebrows and stared at him. \" Think of another, \" he said. So I did. Sure enough, the man began playing the song I was thinking of. His rough voice rang through my ears."

I didn't know that I was the only person in the world who had one of his toys. It was his 10th birthday and it had been marked in some kind of yellow dremmel with a picture of himself. As I peered closer at it I noticed that it was covered in writing that looked very much like CERN's logo. I immediately shook my head. No thanks to science it couldn't be. I stood up and dusted off the dremmel. I drew on the letters a little too hard and a whole lot too slow. At first I thought it was some type of translation error. The next day I found out why. I had a friend at work."

Sorrow and neglect were her only companions in life, and they carried on in death. Miranda's soul couldn't rest, so she liked to walk by the brook. The water gently babbled across smooth rocks. Light filtered through the trees and danced as the cool wind rustled the branches. Miranda walked the edge of the water, letting the breeze carry her along. The butterflies kept her company as she solemnly paced. Across the river she spied a man. He was familiar to her somehow. He cast his fishing rod to the middle of the creek before sitting back down into his chair. His breath smelled of alcohol and cigarettes and his eyes were distant and cold. Miranda remembered."

Five years of dusty broken down towns, dwindling food supplies, and the transition of diarrhea to solid waste as my body adjusted to each town's water supply, and I was back in my hometown. Alone, and crazy. Naturally I filled that void talking to myself and the inanimate objects that were all that was left behind of any other humans. Everything had something to say. I discovered that even in my garden the fruit and vegetables would chat loudly and without end. Sometimes about me. Often about me."

One couple was violently pleasuring each other. Another was an old man, watching a younger woman strip in front of him. A prostitute no doubt. I inhaled slowly, and exhaled. The air was brisk, atleast 30 degrees Fahrenheit. I so small flakes of snow, float peacefully in front of me. I found the room, i was looking for. Ive been tracking this man for 2 weeks. Man was he elusive. The lights flickered on. The red haired man, was mildly attractive, i can see the appeal women had for him. I followed him into the next room, with my sights. The lights flickered on, i was taken aback by the scene. A man, overweight and balding."

They approached him, his naked hand grasping it, And his hand felt as hard as glass, The woman was holding her breath, still crying. He stopped the hold, a voice came through, He understood."

There's really not much we can do to stop him. \" A change came over the President's face, taking it from confusion to concern. He looked up towards the door. What did his screener mean? Is this a joke? Should he let his Secret Service know? His pondering was interrupted by screams and gunshots from outside the Oval Office, immediately cut off by an explosion of light slamming the doors open. The President dove down under his desk, and pulled out his phone to call for help. It didn't turn on."
